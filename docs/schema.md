# Database Schema

The app uses a single SQLite database (`app.db`) stored alongside the application. It holds everything parsed from `Client.txt` — Path of Exile's log file — plus reference data derived from that parsing. The goal is to build a persistent record of play history that survives across app restarts and can power session stats, event history, and alerts.

All timestamps are stored as ISO 8601 text strings (`TEXT NOT NULL`). The database runs in WAL mode with `synchronous=NORMAL` for write throughput during ingestion. Nearly every event table has a `UNIQUE` constraint on its meaningful columns so that re-ingesting the same log file is always safe and idempotent.

---

## Source of data

Everything in this database originates from one of two places:

- **`Client.txt`** — the game's own log file, parsed line by line by the log ingestion pipeline. This is the primary source and covers the vast majority of tables.
- **In-game `/commands`** — a small number of tables are populated from the output of commands like `/passives` and `/played`, which the game echoes into `Client.txt`.

There is no network access, no GGG API, and no other external source.

---

## Design patterns

**Install-scoped data.** The `installs` table is the root anchor for almost everything. Each row represents a distinct PoE installation path. All session and event tables carry `install_id` (via `session_id`) so the app can handle multiple installs without data collisions.

**Normalized reference tables.** Repeating strings (area codes, character names, account names, skill codes, etc.) are deduplicated into small lookup tables and referenced by integer FK. This keeps event tables lean and makes renaming or enriching a concept (e.g., adding a display name to an area) a single-row update.

**Migrations deferred until public release.** Schema migrations are intentionally a no-op until the first public build ships. Until then every user starts from a fresh database, so `initSchema()` uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` everywhere and `migrate()` is a stub.

## Install tracking

### `installs`

Tracks each PoE installation directory the app has seen. This is the root FK for sessions and (transitively) for all event tables. The ingestion cursor columns let the parser resume from where it left off without re-reading the whole file.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `path` | Absolute path to the PoE installation directory. Unique. |
| `file_created_at` | Filesystem creation time of `Client.txt` at last ingest (Unix ms). |
| `file_modified_at` | Filesystem modification time at last ingest. Used to detect a replaced log. |
| `file_size` | File size at last ingest. |
| `last_byte_offset` | Byte position to resume reading from. Zero means never ingested. |

---

## Reference / lookup tables

These tables normalize repeating string values into integer IDs. They rarely change after first insert and are referenced by FK from event tables.

### `areas`

Game zones — maps, towns, the character select screen (NULL area_id elsewhere). Identified by an internal `code` string from the log, enriched with a human-readable `display_name` and monster `level` where known.

### `accounts`

Player account names seen in whispers or chat. Optionally carries `guild_name` when the game includes it in a chat prefix.

### `classes`

Character class names (Marauder, Witch, etc.). Populated on first sight of a character level-up line.

### `characters`

Player characters by name, linked to their `class_id` and last-seen `level`. Covers the local player's own characters; other players' characters appear in `public_chars` if seen only in chat.

### `public_chars`

Characters seen exclusively in public chat channels — name only, no class or level data available. Kept separate from `characters` to avoid polluting the local player's character list with strangers.

### `chat_channels`

Numbered global chat channels the player has joined, with optional `lang` and `name` metadata from the join log line.

### `achievements`

Achievement codes seen unlocked. The code is an internal string from the log; display names are not stored (not available in `Client.txt`).

### `passive_skills`

Passive skill tree nodes — internal `code`, human-readable `name`, and a flag for whether the node is a mastery node. Populated from `/passives` output.

### `passive_quest_sources`

Quest names that grant bonus passive skill points (e.g., "Enemy at the Gate"). Used as the quest dimension in passive point snapshots.

### `hideouts`

Hideout names discovered by the player. Populated on first sight.

### `pvp_matches`

PvP match types seen in queue events (e.g., "Descent: Champions"). Normalized for the same reason as everything else.

### `guild_members`

Links between a `guild_name` (text) and an `account_id`. Populated from guild chat prefixes. Lets you see which accounts belong to a guild over time.

---

## Sessions

A session is a contiguous block of play — from when the game connects to when it disconnects. Sessions are the primary organizational unit: almost every event table references a `session_id` rather than an `install_id` directly.

### `sessions`

One row per play session. Captures the full time range and, at close time, the active account, active character, and last known area. Time columns (`total_secs`, `active_secs`, `afk_secs`) are computed and written when the session ends.

### `session_afk`

Individual AFK intervals within a session. Each row is one contiguous AFK block (`afk_on_at` → `afk_off_at`). Summing `(afk_off_at - afk_on_at)` for a session gives `afk_secs`; the open-ended row (NULL `afk_off_at`) is the current AFK if the player is away.

---

## Movement and time-in-area

### `area_moves`

A lightweight append-only record of every area transition: which install, which area, when. One row per `entered_at` timestamp. Used for timeline reconstruction and area-visit counts.

### `area_time_spans`

Contiguous blocks of time spent in one area within one session. Unlike `area_moves` (which is a raw sequence of transitions), this table is about *duration*: `entered_at` + `exited_at` + computed `duration_secs`. Also tracks `afk_secs` within the span so time-in-area stats can be broken into active vs. idle. `area_id` is NULL during the character select screen. `char_id` reflects the most recently seen character when the span opened, updated on level-up.

---

## Character progression

### `character_level_events`

One row per level-up per character per install. The `UNIQUE(install_id, char_id, level)` constraint means re-ingesting the same log never double-counts a level.

### `character_deaths`

Deaths in HC or SC, with the area and level at time of death. Linked to both session and character so you can see a character's full death history across sessions.

### `character_played_events`

Time-played snapshots from the in-game `/played` command, which outputs cumulative seconds. Stored per session and optionally per `area_time_span` so drift can be measured. Not a direct parse of gameplay — it's the game's own counter echoed to the log.

### `passive_skill_allocations`

Each time the player allocates or deallocates a passive node within a session. `action` is `'allocated'` or `'deallocated'`. Useful for tracing build progression over a league.

### `passive_point_snapshots`

A snapshot of `/passives` output: total available points, how many are allocated, and the same breakdown for ascendancy points. Split between `level_points` (from leveling) and `quest_points` (from quests). One snapshot per `/passives` invocation.

### `passive_snapshot_quests`

The per-quest breakdown within a snapshot — which quests have granted passive points and how many. Child table of `passive_point_snapshots`.

---

## Social and chat

### `whispers`

Direct messages in both directions (`direction` = `'from'` or `'to'`). Linked to the session they occurred in. The player's own account/character is implicit from the session; `player_name` is always the other party.

### `chats`

Public chat messages. `channel` stores the raw prefix character: `#` global, `$` trade, `%` party, `&` guild. `guild_tag` is the optional `<TAG>` prefix some messages carry. Senders are stored as `public_char_id` (→ `public_chars`), not `characters`, because chat senders are strangers whose class/level we don't know.

### `chat_channel_joins`

Each time the player joins a numbered global chat channel. Used to know which channel the player was on at any given time.

---

## Game events

These tables capture specific recognizable moments from the log. Each one is scoped to a session and has a timestamp.

### `quest_events`

Quest milestones: completing a quest, entering a story area for the first time, etc. `event_type` is a string code identifying the specific milestone. `area_id` is where it happened when determinable.

### `achievement_events`

Achievements unlocked during a session, referenced by `achievement_id` → `achievements`.

### `hideout_discovered_events`

First time a hideout is discovered. `area_id` is the area the player was in when the discovery line appeared (usually the hideout's own area).

### `pvp_queue_events`

PvP queue entries: when the player entered the queue, how many players were in it at that moment, and when the queue was cancelled (if it was). `match_id` → `pvp_matches`.

### `zone_ruleset_failed_events`

Logged when the game reports that a zone's ruleset check failed — appears in racing or HC-validation contexts. `ruleset_name` is the raw string from the log.

### `general_events`

Catch-all for recognized log lines that don't fit a dedicated table. `event_type` is a string code. Adding a new specific table for a given `event_type` is the natural migration path when a category grows large enough to warrant its own columns.

---

## App state

### `app_state`

A simple key→value store for operational metadata the app needs to persist but that isn't user configuration and isn't game data. Currently used to track when each database maintenance tier last ran (`last_routine_check`, `last_full_check`, `last_repair`) so the scheduler can decide whether a full or repair run is due. If this table is unreadable the app treats it as if no checks have ever run, which is safe — it just means maintenance runs sooner rather than later.

---

## Event history spine

### `events`

A lightweight chronological index across all event types, used by the historical events panel. One row is written here (in the same transaction) every time a row is inserted into any of the specific event tables above. `event_type` is a short string identifying the source table (e.g. `'whisper'`, `'death'`, `'achievement'`); `source_id` is the rowid in that table. An index on `occurred_at DESC` makes paginated queries (`LIMIT`/`OFFSET`) fast without scanning every event table via a `UNION ALL`.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `occurred_at` | Timestamp copied from the source event row. |
| `event_type` | String key identifying the source table. |
| `source_id` | Rowid of the corresponding row in the source table. |
