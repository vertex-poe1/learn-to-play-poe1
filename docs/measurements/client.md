## File

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| File | `Client.txt` |
| Size | 96.6 MB (96,597,230 bytes) |
| Total lines | 930,092 |
| Lines per KB | ~9.9 (103.8 bytes/line avg) |
| Area visits recorded | 39,614 |

## Chunk size

The ingest processes 10,000 matched lines per SQLite transaction (lines that don't match the timestamp regex are not counted).

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Lines per chunk | 10,000 |
| Average chunk size | **0.96 MB** |
| Implied avg line length | ~101 bytes |
| Chunks to cover 96.6 MB | ~99 |

## Throughput

The app runs two passes: a cold non-live pass (cancelled early once the UI is ready) then a live pass from the last safe commit offset.

| Phase | Bytes processed | Wall time | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold pass (non-live, cancelled at 6 chunks) | ~5.8 MB | ~1.3 s | ~4.5 MB/s |
| Live pass (offset 6,048,241 → EOF) | ~90.5 MB | ~36.4 s | ~2.5 MB/s |

The live pass rate is lower than the cold pass because periodic SQLite WAL flush pauses dominate overall time:

| Condition | Per-chunk time | Parse rate |
|---|---|---|
| Fast chunks (commit_ms < 10 ms) | 170–215 ms | 4.5–5.6 MB/s |
| Slow chunks (WAL flush) | 800–1100 ms extra | pulls average to ~2.5 MB/s |

WAL flush pauses (~750–1100 ms) occur roughly every 5–6 chunks throughout the live pass.
