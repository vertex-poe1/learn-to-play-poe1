# Roadmap

Everything here can be considered aspirational and will likely never see the light of day. Item ideas may not be fleshed out and change drastically or be considered an actual bad idea the morning after we wrote it down in the middle of the night.

## Goal: Basic Features

- [ ] Log screen UI: flesh out the session list — richer session cards (zone count, notable events, loot highlights), expandable inline detail, filtering by character/date/duration, and visual distinction between ongoing and completed sessions
- [ ] Guide screen: context-sensitive help panel designed for a side monitor; content auto-changes based on detected in-game activity (zone, boss, league mechanic); surfaces relevant tips, mechanics explanations, and checklists without the player having to search
- [ ] Stash screen: search and browse stash items across all tabs; identify gear upgrades already in the stash; surface crafting opportunities on existing items to close the gap to an upgrade; character gear review against current build
- [ ] Profile screen: account overview and splash screen; tracks goals (player-defined targets), accomplishments (unofficial achievements derived from session history), and a summary of playtime, characters, and milestones
- [ ] Universal Search: a single search bar that queries across all screens (sessions, stash, chat, DMs, goals, accomplishments) and surfaces ranked results; accessible via the search icon in the top navbar

## Goal: Public release

- [ ] Public release (first public build shipped to users)


## Goal: Event Detection

- [ ] Multi-client detection: investigate whether multiple game instances can run from the same install directory or require separate installs. If separate installs, each PID maps 1:1 to a Client.txt log file, enabling per-instance log tailing and accurate session-to-PID matching for the "Game is running" card timestamp enrichment.
- [ ] Investigate `replace_object` log lines as a source of in-map events
- [ ] Investigate `window` "Lost focus" / "Gained focus" lines as AFK or session-pause signals


## Goal: Companion

- [ ] Log screen session detail flashing and slow updates: investigate UI flicker and sluggish refresh when viewing a session's detail on the Log screen — profile rebuild triggers, widget deletion timing, and whether the same deferred-clear fix applied to CurrentPage is needed here
- [ ] Historical events panel: virtual scrolling via QListView + QAbstractItemModel + QStyledItemDelegate (replaces load-N-at-a-time approach; delegate ports existing custom-paint logic from NotificationWidget; enables millions of rows with no memory growth)
- [ ] Pagination prev/next scroll feel: when prev/next 50 loads, the viewport should appear to stay put as content loads around you rather than snapping the first old record to the top of the screen; the button bar disappearing on load causes a visible scroll jump that should be absorbed so the experience feels like the page simply grew
- [ ] Auto start on boot (Windows registry `HKCU\…\Run`; Linux `.desktop` autostart)
- [ ] Companion mode: web API only, no overlay, no PoE install required

## Goal: Overlay

- [ ] Game overlay interactive content beyond proof-of-concept text

## Goal: Chat
- [x] Chat/whisper panel: three views — whispers-only, chats-only, and a combined view (UNION ALL of both tables with a source column to distinguish them); chats are not in the events spine so the combined view is its own dedicated query, not a filter on events
- [ ] Chats tab — channel-number filtering: the Filter panel UI is built but "show only global #3" / "show only trade #2" can't be wired up until `chats` has a `channel_number INTEGER` column (schema migration to v4) and `LogIngestWorker` tracks the current channel join per install so new rows get the right number on ingest
- [ ] Copy support for chat/DM excerpts: select one or more message rows in the chat or DM view and copy them as plain text so conversations can be shared on forums or Discord without combing the raw log
- [ ] Local chat capture: parse and store local (area) chat lines from `Client.txt` so the Local checkbox in the chat filter panel becomes functional; requires identifying the log line format and adding a `local` channel variant to the ingest worker
- [ ] DM/whisper push notification while tabbed out: fire a system-tray or OS notification when an incoming whisper arrives and the game does not hold focus; hooks into the live event bus whisper emission so no separate polling is needed
- [ ] Tab-out chat client: compose and send a single message to the game's chat box via keystroke injection while the player is out-of-game; one typed message → one keystroke sequence delivered to the client's input box → one in-game send; limited to one message at a time per ADR-004 (one outside action maps to one inside action); depends on the game window being open and the player being logged in

## Goal: Reminders

- [ ] Kirac mission refresh reminder (SSF): notify the player when Kirac's daily missions have refreshed (midnight local time) and flag when a unique map is available in the mission pool; in SSF Kirac is the only reliable source of unique maps so knowing exactly when to check is high-value; needs a configurable alert in the live-alert rule engine or a dedicated daily-reset timer


## Goal: Companion as overlay widget

- [ ] Game-overlay corner widget: render a compact DM/alert panel inside the overlay window so the player can tuck it into a corner of the game screen; requires the panel to look good at small sizes first (already mobile-friendly after DM drill-down redesign)


## Goal: Mobile

- [ ] Mobile companion app (iOS/Android): UI design can be ported from the current mobile-style layouts; real-time features would use a native-app-to-server API where the desktop companion app exposes a local server, with Client.txt events relayed to the mobile device over LAN or via a relay


## Goal: Native cross-platform (Mac, Linux)

- [ ] macOS overlay (`NSWindow` level + `ignoresMouseEvents`; needs PoE Mac client testing)
